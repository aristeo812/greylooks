# Greylooks GTK2/3, Openbox and Metacity theme
## Overview
The theme is based on Clearlooks, Clearlooks-Phenix and TraditionalOk from the [mate-themes](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-themes) package with certain excerpts from the [Mint-X](https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-themes) theme. Some bugs of the original theme were fixed here. The colors are carefully picked to be easy on eyes and generally eye-candy. Openbox theme in Greylooks is designed to be consistent with the corresponding GTK theme. The theme is overall Gruvbox- and Redshift-friendly.

## Usage
Just install the theme into your `/usr/share/themes` (for systemwide installation) or `~/.local/share/themes` (for local install) directory.
In order for the GTK2 theme to be working, it is necessary to install the `gtk-engines` or `gtk2-engines` package (depending on the distribution).
