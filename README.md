# Greylooks GTK2/3, Openbox and Metacity Themes

## Overview
The themes are based on good ol' Clearlooks, Clearlooks-Phenix and TraditionalOk from the [mate-themes](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-themes) package with certain excerpts from the glorious [Mint-X](https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-themes) theme. Some minor [bugs](../assets/screenshots/traditionalok-greylooks-comparison.png) of the original theme were fixed here. The colors are carefully picked to be easy on the eyes and generally eye-candy. Openbox themes in Greylooks are designed to be consistent with the corresponding GTK themes. The themes are overall [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)- and [Redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift)-friendly.

## Openbox Themes

## Usage
Just install the theme directories into your `/usr/share/themes` (for systemwide installation) or `~/.local/share/themes` (for local install) directory.
In order for the GTK2 themes to be working, it is necessary to install the `gtk-engines` or `gtk2-engines` package (depending on the distribution).

## Licenses
GTK and Metacity themes share the original LGPL v. 2.1 license of the [mate-themes](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-themes) package. [Openbox themes](https://github.com/vbrand1984/greylooks-openbox) are under the GPL v. 2.0 license.
