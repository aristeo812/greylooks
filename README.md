# Greylooks GTK2/3, Openbox and Metacity theme
## Overview
The theme is based on good ol' Clearlooks, Clearlooks-Phenix and TraditionalOk from the [mate-themes](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-themes) package with certain excerpts from the glorious [Mint-X](https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-themes) theme. Some [bugs](../assets/screenshots/traditionalok-greylooks-comparison.png) of the original theme were fixed here. The colors are carefully picked to be easy on eyes and generally eye-candy. Openbox theme in Greylooks is designed to be consistent with the corresponding GTK theme. The theme is overall [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)- and [Redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift)-friendly.

## Usage
Just install the theme into your `/usr/share/themes` (for systemwide installation) or `~/.local/share/themes` (for local install) directory.
In order for the GTK2 theme to be working, it is necessary to install the `gtk-engines` or `gtk2-engines` package (depending on the distribution).
